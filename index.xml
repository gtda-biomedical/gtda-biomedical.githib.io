Cubature formulas of the first type are obtained through interpolation by variational splines. This set of formulas is exact on spaces of variational splines on graphs. Since bandlimited functions can be obtained as limits of variational splines we obtain cubature formulas which are approximately exact on spaces of bandlimited functions.</description></item><item><title>Dinner</title><link>https://sampta2023.github.io/dinner/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sampta2023.github.io/dinner/</guid><description>Dinner on Wednesday will be at the Madison Beach Hotel from 6-7pm, and you must register for dinner by Day 1.
