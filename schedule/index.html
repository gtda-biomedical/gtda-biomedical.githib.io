summit is 3.5 miles of mostly flat walking through the Yale campus
and then onto paved neighborhood streets. There is a short, strenuous
climb at the end, ascending 300 vertical feet up a series of giant
stone steps. The spectacular views from the top look out over New

retrace the 3.5 miles, or take a convenient Yale shuttle back to the
venue/hotels to shorten the journey. <strong>Comfortable walking shoes and
a water bottle are recommended.</strong></li></ol><p>Please indicate your preference of excursion by filling out the
